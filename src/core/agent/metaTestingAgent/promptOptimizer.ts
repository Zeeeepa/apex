**When to call:**
- After 3+ failed attempts on similar approaches
- At budget checkpoints (20%/40%/60%/80%)
- When pivoting to a new approach
- After discovering a significant constraint

**What this does:**
1. Reads all adaptations (store_adaptation records)
2. Categorizes approaches by success/failure
3. Extracts learned constraints
4. Generates optimized execution guidance
5. Writes to execution_prompt_optimized.md

**The optimized prompt includes:**
- KNOWN CONSTRAINTS: Approaches that definitely won't work
- WORKING APPROACHES: Tactics that succeeded (prioritize these)
- EXHAUSTED APPROACHES: Tactics that failed (skip these)

## How to Apply This Guidance

1. **Before each hypothesis:**
   - Check if your planned approach matches a KNOWN CONSTRAINT
   - If so, choose a different technique

2. **Prioritize working patterns:**
   - If a similar approach worked before, try variations of it
   - Successful approaches often reveal productive attack vectors

3. **Avoid exhausted approaches:**
   - Don't retry exact approaches that failed
   - However, variations or different targets may still work

4. **Update this guidance:**
   - Call store_adaptation after each significant attempt
   - Call optimize_prompt to regenerate this guidance

Remember: Direct-first economics - always prefer the shortest path to your objective.
